This repository contains the implementation of a feature for the Clearmind app, a mental health application designed to enhance user experience through mood-based customization. <br>
The feature allows users to tag their journal entries with moods, which dynamically changes the background color of the journal entry page.<br> 
Additionally, users can store and analyze their thoughts categorized by mood.<br>

1. Mood Tagging<br>

Users can tag journal entries with one of three moods: Happy, Sad, or Neutral.<br>
Each tag is stored alongside the journal entry in the local database.<br>

The background color of the journal entry page changes according to the tagged mood:<br>
  Happy: Yellow<br>

Journal entries are categorized by mood, allowing users to view and analyze mood-related data efficiently.<br>
